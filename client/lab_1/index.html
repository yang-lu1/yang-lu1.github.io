<h1>Yang Lu Lab 1: Intro to HTML</h1> 

<h2>First, the basics.</h2>

You need the following to build your website.
<ul>
<li>HTML and CSS</li>
<li>Node.js</li>
<li>And other web development frameworks</li>
</ul>
<br>
You should list your top 5 albums below. This is to show you know how to use a list element.
<br>
<ol>
<li>HORIZONS</li>
<li>DIVISIONS</li>
<li>DIFFERENT WORLD</li>
<li>FOR YOUR ENTERTAINMENT</li>
<li>THE WAR</li>
</ol>
<h2>Let's Try Some Inline Elements</h2>
<p>Sometimes you want to draw <em>attention to something</em> in a line of text.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to <strong>strongly emphasize something</strong> in the text.</p>
<p>Sometimes you want to <strong><em>do both</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>Empty Elements</h2>

Soft line breaks can't wrap anything.
<br>
Neither can image tags, or hard lines.
<br>
Add a hard line under here, and make sure you've used some soft line breaks to match your page to the sample.

<h2>Images</h2> 
<p>Don't forget to use alt text on your images. It's important for accessibility.</p>
<br>
<img src="images/images/mochi.gif" alt="gif of smiling mochi"/>
<img src="images/images/mochi.jpg" alt="jpg of smiling mochi"/>
<img src="images/images/mochi.png" alt="png of smiling mochi"/>
<img src="images/images/mochi.svg" alt="svg of smiling mochi"/>
